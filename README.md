# CT_Project-master
 
This project explores application of Machine Learning Techniques in Medical Image processing. My project aimed at finding pathological regions inside lungs to identify calcite deposits regions and to compare the CT images for a patient captured in course of diagnosis to identify any potential reduction/increment in the pathological regions.

I did this project under the guidance of Prof. Sergey Axyonov (Associate Professor, National Research Tomsk Polytechnic University). 

For the creating Masks of Pathological regions, I used various image processing techniques like filtering, thresholding, segmentation to seperate the lung regions with other regions like tissues etc. I also applied K-Means to segment the lung regions.
